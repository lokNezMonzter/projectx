In particular, we observe that performance is often highest when rele- vant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts, even for explicitly long-context models.

These models perform downstream tasks primarily via prompting: all relevant task specification and data to process is formatted as a textual input context, and the model returns a generated text completion. These input contexts can contain thousands of tokens, espe- cially when language models are used to process long documents (e.g., legal or scientific documents, conversation histories, etc.) or when language mod- els are augmented with external information (e.g.,\n",

In this setting, we control (i) the input context length by changing the number of documents in the input context (akin to retrieving more or less documents in retrieval-augmented generation), and (ii) control the position of the relevant information within the input context by changing the order of the documents to place the relevant document at the beginning, middle or end of the context.\n",

      "        NarrativeText: Given that language models struggle to retrieve and use relevant information in the multi-document question answering task, to what extent can lan- guage models even retrieve from their input con- texts? We study this question with a synthetic key- value retrieval task, which is designed to be a mini- mal testbed for the basic ability to retrieve matching tokens from the input context. In this task, models are given a collection of JSON-formatted key-value pairs and must return the value associated with a specific key. Similar to the multi-document QA task, the key-value retrieval task admits controlled changes to the input context length (adding more key-value pairs) and the position of relevant in- formation. Although some models perform the synthetic key-value retrieval task perfectly, other models struggle to simply retrieve matching tokens that occur in the middle of their input context and continue to exhibit a U-shaped performance curve. To better understand why language models strug- gle to robustly access and use information in their input contexts, we study the role of model archi- tecture (decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder), query- aware contextualization, and instruction fine-tuning (§4).

In contrast to our controlled multi-document QA task, where the context always contains exactly one document that answers the question, none or many of the top k documents may contain the an- swer in the open-domain QA setting. When re- trieving from Wikipedia to answer queries from NaturalQuestions-Open, we find that model perfor- mance saturates long before retriever recall satu- rates, indicating that current models fail to effec- tively use additional retrieved documents—using 50 documents instead of 20 retrieved documents only marginally improves performance (∼1.5% for GPT-3.5-Turbo and ∼1% for claude-1.3).\n",

To contextualize model perfor- mance, we also evaluate on the closed-book and oracle settings (Table 1). In the closed-book setting, models are not given any documents in their input context, and must rely on their parametric memory to generate the correct answer. On the other hand, in the oracle setting, language models are given the single document that contains the answer and must use it to answer the question.\n",

Even if a language model can take in 16K tokens, is it actually beneficial to provide 16K tokens of context? The answer to this question is ultimately downstream task-specific since it de- pends on the marginal value of the added context and the model’s ability to effectively use long input contexts, but we perform a case study with open- domain question answering on NaturalQuestions- Open to better understand this trade-off in existing language models.\n",

These results, coupled with the observation that models are often better at retriev- ing and using information at the start or end of the input contexts, suggest that effective rerank- ing of retrieved documents (pushing relevant infor- mation closer to the start of the input context) or ranked list truncation (retrieving fewer documents when appropriate; Arampatzis et al., 2009) may be promising directions for improving how language- model-based readers use retrieved context.\n",

      "        NarrativeText: The pioneering work of Khandelwal et al. (2018) showed that small LSTM language models make increasingly coarse use of longer-term context; Sankar et al. (2019) found similar results in di- alogue models. In a similar vein, Daniluk et al. (2017) find that attentive LSTM language mod- els tend to mainly use recent history. Petroni et al. (2020) were among the first to demonstrate the potential of combining context from an in- formation retrieval system with a pretrained lan- guage models for unsupervised question answering. O’Connor and Andreas (2021) found that many information-destroying operations had marginal ef- fects on Transformer LMs’ predictions. Krishna et al. (2022) found that long-context neural gen- eration in modestly-sized Transformer language models degenerates because models fail to prop- erly condition on long context. Finally, studying long-context models, Sun et al. (2021) found that longer contexts improves prediction of only a few tokens, an empirical finding consistent with the theory of Sharan et al. (2018), who showed that sequence distributions with bounded mutual infor- mation necessarily lead to marginal average predic- tion benefits from increasingly long context. Qin et al. (2023) analyze how efficient Transformers perform on a variety of long-context downstream NLP tasks, finding that long-context transformers are recency-biased and do not effectively use long- range context.\n",

We show that language model perfor- mance degrades significantly when changing the position of relevant information, indicating that models struggle to robustly access and use infor- mation in long input contexts. In particular, per- formance is often lowest when models must use information in the middle of long input contexts. We conduct a preliminary investigation of the role of (i) model architecture, (ii) query-aware contextu- alization, and (iii) instruction fine-tuning to better understand how they affect how language models use context. Finally, we conclude with a practi- cal case study of open-domain question answering, finding that the performance of language model readers saturates far before retriever recall. Our results and analysis provide a better understanding of how language models use their input context and provides new evaluation protocols for future long-context models.\n",

The 13B base model has a dramatic primacy and recency bias—there is a 20-point accuracy disparity between the best- and worst-case performance. Applying additional fine- tuning to the 13B seems to slightly reduce this bias (10-point worst-case degradation), but the bias remains significant. However, the 70B models with and without additional fine-tuning have largely similar trends (showing both primacy and recency bias), and additional fine-tuning minimally changes the positional bias severity.\n",
